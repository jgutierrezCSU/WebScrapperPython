Web Scrapper using python :
As of now it is dedicated to scrape Walmart website.
Additionally It compares previous "scrapes" , if the prices have changed it will send an email.

UPDATE:
Walmart site is ever changing, this code works fine as long as some code is adjusted (usualy changing the way you get tags and HTML code).
Overall it a great structure to get started with Web Scrapping
